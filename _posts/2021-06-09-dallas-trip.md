# Trip to Dallas, 06/09/2021 - 06/22/2021
Nathan went to vist his parents in Dallas, TX between June 9th and the 22nd. Instead of breaking up the posts day by day like in Yellowstone, this post will hold all of the fun and exciting things we did in Dallas during the summer heat.

# House of Blues
In downtown Dallas there is a resturant chain inspired by _The Blues Brothers_ movie (great movie by the way). They have live music and southern inspired food (a la the resturant run by Aretha Franklin in the movie). The music was great, and the food was delicious! I highly recommend coming to this establishment. When we left around 8 pm, there was a line for a few blocks for the One Direction night, so if you want dinner be sure to get a reservation or arrive earlier.

# Hike at Cedar Ridge Preserve
In Cedar Ridge there are a handful of nature areas, including a state park. Our favorite is the Cedar Ridge preserve, where there are miles and miles of trails, a lake, scenic overlooks, and free admission. Other good places include the nearby State Park.

# Kayaking on Grapevine Lake
We went with a guide onto Grapevine Lake with a bunch of Kayaks for 2 hours. We had a blast! The water was pretty smooth, but the guide was talkative and showed us some fun coves to paddle to/around. It was super hot, so 2 hours was plenty of time to kayak, and it was well worth the drive!

# Fort Worth Stockyards
This was a really fun attraction. We got to see Texas longhorn cattle walk down the street! Amazing

# Perot Museum
We went during "Thursdays on Tap", which was 6-10pm with food trucks, beer, live music (piped through the sound system all throughout the museum), and the main exhibits being open. Dad got to race a T-Rex (he lost, badly), and we all could participate in a slow motion camera (10x slowdown!), and play with robots

# Horse Riding at Marshall Creek Ranch
This was a super fun morning horse ride where we had a blast. The horses loved to take impromptu snacks along the way (even though they weren't supposed to!). We got to trot a little bit. Since Lake Grapevine is flooded we weren't able to do a lakefront trail, but we could still see it from time to time. While we didn't see any deer, apparently deer are populous in that area.

# Six Flags?
