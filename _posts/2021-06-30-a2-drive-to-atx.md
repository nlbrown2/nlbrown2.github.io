# Day One: Ann Arbor -> Indy
Didn't do much but get ice cream

# Day Two: Indy -> St Louis
Went to the zoo and saw Rhinos and fed Lorikeets!

# Day Three: St Louis -> Poplar Bluff
Saw the Arch (the 60th and newest national park!) as well as Mark Twain National Forest (many buggos). This means we saw the oldest and newest national parks in the span of 2 months! That's pretty good.

# Day Four: Poplar Bluff -> Little Rock
Mini golf, bumber boats, batting cage, air hockey, skee-ball, milkshakes!

# Day Five: Little Rock -> Dallas
Meet up w my parents and watch fireworks and have game night!

# Day Six: Dallas -> Austin
It rained heavily on the drive down! Saw a bucc-es (?) and got the keys to our new place!
