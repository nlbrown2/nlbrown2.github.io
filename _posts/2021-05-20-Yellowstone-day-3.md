# Day 3 (May 20th, 2021)
## 9:30 am
Good morning Gardiner! We got up, chose a place to get some good breakfast, and looked into the weather and activities for the day. The weather had a dreary outlook, with showers/rain all day. It was also going to be significantly colder than the previous day, with the highs being about 55.

We went to the Yellowstone Grill for breakfast, where I got biscuits & gravy, scrambled eggs, an extra sausage patty, and hash browns. Dana got a delicious mix of corned beef and hash browns, with toast and two sunny-side-up eggs.

We get back to the hotel and spend a bit more time getting ready for the inclement weather and making backup plans in case of heavy rain. We also had to spend some time stretching and rehydrating after the arduous day yesterday.

## 1 pm
And we’re off! First stop - Roosevelt Arch outside of the park. That was when we realized it was incredibly windy! It was still sunny at that time, but some ominous fog was rolling over the nearby mountains. When taking pictures of the Arch, we found out the pillars were hollow! They also made for great wind tunnels (brr!!).

After this, we drove over to Norris Geyser Basin. The drive took about an hour but was very pretty with some lovely pull-outs. We even got to see some bison along the way!

We considered exploring Norris but really wanted to visit Artist Point and realized we were running short on time, so we headed East. A half-hour later (and some beautiful pull-outs of lakes and such on the way), we were at the South Rim Drive, which connected us to Artist Point. The views were spectacular! We got to see the Yellowstone waterfalls and parts of the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone! The rocks were multicolored, and we can totally see how this place got its name.

Then, we headed back up to the North Rim, where we stopped by Lookout Point, Grand View, and Inspiration Point. These were all very stunning and provided different (occasionally better) views of the Grand Canyon or specific Yellowstone Falls (i.e., the Upper Falls).

For some fantastic pictures from this trip, be sure to visit the Yellowstone photo gallery [here]({{ site.base_url }}{% link _pictures/yellowstone.md %}).

## 6 pm
What a day! We start heading back, and we saw a bunch of cars all pulled off the side of the road! Not wanting to miss out, we pull off as well and overhear that someone recently saw a grizzly bear! Unfortunately, it had wandered behind some trees, and after a minute or two, it finally started to rain. We were able to see some elk on the top of the hill grazing. I was hoping the bear was going to chase after them, but this isn’t National Geographic :/. Cold and slightly wet, we decided to continue our journey back. Along the way, we saw some more bison and an entire herd of elk next to the road! It was lovely.

## 7:30 pm
Dinnertime! After seeing all that elk, we decided we wanted a taste. So, we both grab some elk cheeseburgers with a side of fries. Since dine-in was full, we took it back to the room and scarfed it down in a handful of minutes. It was delicious! Just what we needed after a long, hard day of...driving?

After dinner, we decide to freshen up, watch a TV show (_The Queens Gambit_), and update our travel blog!
