# Day 8 (May 24th, 2021)
Today is our last day in the park! :(. Today our plan is to visit West Thumb Geyser Basin, maybe hike (the weather forecast isn’t great though), and eat some huckleberry ice cream!

## 10:30 am
Rise and shine! This morning, we decided to head to Yogi’s Waffles and Grill for some tasty crepes :P. Dana got some chicken, mushroom, and swiss crepes while I got a breakfast crepe - two eggs, cheddar cheese, and bacon! They were both delicious. On our way to Yogi’s, we saw a nearby shop with huckleberry ice cream but knew we had to have breakfast first.

## 12:30 am
Time to enter the park. Thankfully, the west entrance wasn’t as backed up today, so we could make okay time into the park and past Madison Junction. We headed towards Old Faithful in pursuit of the West Thumb area and hopes of ice cream. We realized that since Grant Village was only open in the summer, our only chance for huckleberry ice cream in the park was at Old Faithful. We decide to stop in while the weather is still nice (who wants to eat ice cream in the rain?). Unfortunately for us, plenty of others had the same idea, and the line for huckleberry ice cream was so long that they actually ran out of it before we could get some! We were devastated until we realized that the mountain berry flavor had huckleberry in it. While waiting in line, Dana got some gifts for her family - huckleberry jam for her sister and some coasters for her parents.
Just when we were about to take a bite, we heard that Old Faithful was only 10 minutes from erupting. Not wanting to miss out (even though we had already seen it), we walked on over to the observation area and waited while enjoying the traces of huckleberry in our scoop.

## 3:42 pm
Old Faithful erupts right on schedule! It had an even bigger eruption this time, so I’m glad we stuck around to see it. We tried to leave a minute or so early to beat the crowd out of the parking lot and start heading toward the West Thumb Geyser Basin.

When we got into the West Thumb area, we were in awe of the beautiful scenery of Yellowstone Lake - the largest lake above 7,000 ft in elevation! From where we were, we could see what we presumed to be the Teton Range in the background, with the large, smooth waters of the lake extending out in front of us.

Finally, we found the West Thumb Geyser Basin and were able to see even more geological marvels - warm & colorful pools, steaming geysers right on the lakeshore, and gurgling mud pots. During our time there, it started to rain, which was a bummer.

## 7 pm
We got back to the hotel (needed to pee) and weren’t sure where we wanted to go to dinner. After some looking around, we tried to visit Madison Crossing, but the line was massive (over an hour wait). So, we decided to head back to Yogi’s for some burgers. Dana got a Philly cheesesteak with soup on the side, and I got an “Old Faithful” burger (since I saw it erupt today) with grilled veggies on the burger. It was pretty good!

Afterward, we went next door to get the true huckleberry ice cream from the shop we had seen this morning. The server was very kind, and the ice cream was delicious! Then, we went souvenir shopping at the nearby stores to find Dana a Yellowstone shirt.

Tired from our long day and needing to have an early day tomorrow for the flight back, we went home and packed our things.
