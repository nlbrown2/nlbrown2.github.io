# Day Two (May 19th, 2021)
## 9 am
Rise and shine! After a good night’s rest, we got dressed and packed up for breakfast. We went to the Tumbleweed Bookstore and Cafe, which was lovely. I got a delicious egg, ham, and swiss sandwich on an Asiago bagel. Dana got a delicious roast beef, turkey, ham, tomato, lettuce & mayo in a tomato wrap. Yum! I also had some lovely huckleberry tea that was a great way to start the day.
## 10:30 am
Time to enter Yellowstone! We took a photo at the park entrance, then made our way into Mammoth Hot Springs. The drive into the park was fantastic - plenty of glacier-carved mountains, views of the rapid Yellowstone River, and beautiful rock formations.

We got a parking spot at Mammoth and went over to check out the hot springs. These hot springs are a bit different from normal ones - they will kill you! They’re filled with thermophiles (tiny organisms that love the superhot environment of the pools at the hot springs), sulfuric acid eating bacteria, and cyanobacteria! The smell of sulfur was _very_ strong (sulfur smells like rotten eggs - Dana’s fave!). The boardwalks around were very convenient and got us very close to the beautiful pools and terraces all around us! It was neat seeing the steam and running water all appear to come from nowhere at all.

## 12:30 pm
We saw some bison!! They were just loafing around in the sun, grabbing the occasional snack. That was very cool, but I feel bad for whoever parked near them!

After this, we went into the Yellowstone General Store to find some souvenirs and grab some bear spray for our hikes later in the day/week. We got some lovely mugs, a wooden bookmark (important addition to the book previously obtained), a pair of sunglasses for Dana, and a fridge magnet.

Next, we got some lunch from the next-door restaurant to refuel. Dana got a Nathan’s chili dog (:P), and I got a turkey and swiss sandwich. Who knew that the sandwich would have the lettuce, tomato, and condiments all packaged separately?? Very intriguing indeed.

## 2 pm
Time to start our day hike! With our water bottles full and the bear spray readily accessible, we went out to the Beaver Ponds trailhead, an approximately 5-mile loop. We saw some stunning landscapes, multiple beaver ponds, huge dung piles, and some amazing animals during the hike. In all, we saw prairie dogs, deer, elk, ducks, and a muskrat! Quite a diverse group. We weathered through some 5-minute showers and steep elevation changes. Dana got an interesting mosquito bite that made us worried in the final hour, but it turned out just fine.

## 6 pm
We finished the hike! It was quite long but well worth it. We decided to cap the day off by seeing Mammoth Hot Springs’ upper terraces (the trail from the lower terraces was closed off). After a short drive, we saw some more beautiful springs full of vibrant colors. One was super smelly (yet not named Gassy Spring - a major oversight in my opinion). Tired and hungry, we decided to head out for some dinner and rest. We saw some more bison and a handful of elk on the way out! The bison herd had returned to their prior spot, but all were snacking this time (it was cooling off, so no more sunbathing I suppose).

## 7 pm
After seeing the elk burger place was closed, we tried to snag some pizza/pasta. The wait times were pretty bad with no seating, so we decided to get some burritos at the place next door. That was a great decision - a significant upgrade. The person making our burritos had also recently hiked the Beaver Ponds Trail, which was a nice connection. Our burritos were massive, tasty, and filling - a hearty meal.

We lugged our full selves up the hill to our hotel and cleaned up after dinner. After some stretches and massages, we had a fun time reflecting on our successful day, and we look forward to the next one!

## Stats of the day:
- Walked about 9 miles
- Climbed 117 floors (change in elevation)
