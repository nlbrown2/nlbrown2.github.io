# Day 7 (May 23rd, 2021)
Today is the day of Dana’s interview at TUNCOM, a D.O. school in Nevada. It’s from 2-7 pm, so we didn’t have much planned for the day.
## 10:30 am
Rise and shine! We prep the room for the interview and do a dry-run of the Internet to ensure it can handle the Zoom call well. We find a way to have the audio come over the phone to help with any internet fluctuations.

## 1 pm
I run off to grab some lunch for the two of us. I get some takeout sandwiches from Ernie’s, which was close, fast, and delicious (what a beautiful combo). While I’m there, a family comes in and asks for a breakfast menu - at least we aren’t the only ones who get up late around here!

## 1:45 pm
Dana signs into her call, and I head out to give her some privacy / not be a distraction.
Dana then gets 5 hours of presentations and group interactions before her final one-on-one interview with a faculty member. When she is about to be put into her breakout room to meet with him, the Internet stops working. What a rush! Since the phone call is still running, she can still be connected via audio, which is a good sign. She texts the coordinator that her Internet cut out, and she promptly disconnects & reconnects to the WiFi so she can re-join the call. Luckily after that she was all good to go!

She had prepped for some of the questions (such as “Why are you interested in Nevada?” and “Why D.O. and not M.D.?”), which was good! She thinks the most challenging question she was asked was, “Why are you better than every other candidate, and what sets you apart? Why YOU?” This was even harder than the ethical question of “How do you handle an anti-vaxxer parent?”

In the meantime, I call home and chat for a few hours before looking into free/cheap, and easy ways to get these blog posts published on the Internet. I think I’ve found a good way to do so, but it will require a bit more investigation.

## 8 pm
To celebrate Dana’s masterful interview skills, we went to Serenity Bistro, an upscale diner in town. I got a fantastic ribeye steak with veggies and mashed potatoes, and Dana got butternut squash ravioli with candied walnuts. Yum! We also had to get some wine, so I got a merlot, and Dana got a dessert wine (to match her sweet & tasty entree). It was super delicious, and we loved every bite!

## 10 pm
We come back to the hotel and watch an episode of _The Queen’s Gambit_ before updating our blog. We are excited for what tomorrow has in store - we plan on visiting the West Thumb, perhaps followed by Haden Valley.

## Daily Stats
We didn’t do any exercise today, so we don’t wanna talk about it ;)
