# Day 4 (May 21st, 2021)
## 9 am
I get dressed and head downstairs to snag a cup of tea and coffee for Dana and me, respectively. We get ready for the day and finalize packing. Today is the last day at the North Entrance! Tonight we check into a hotel in West Yellowstone, where we will complete our Yellowstone journey.

## 10:30 am
Time to check out and get some breakfast! Wanting something light after those tasty elk burgers last night, we head back to the Tumbleweed Bookstore and Cafe. I got a breakfast burrito this time, and Dana got a sandwich with green apple, brown mustard, white cheddar, and ham! There was a bit of a wait for the food, so we read our books! For part of it, Dana read from a nearby _Huckleberry_ cookbook, which contained some very delicious-looking recipes!

## 11:30 am
Time to enter the park from the north for the last time! This morning we headed east into Lamar Valley with high hopes of seeing some wildlife! Before we could get there, we saw many herds of bison! While we had previously cumulatively seen around 5 bison, between all the herds, we saw almost 100! We saw babies loafing and eating, bison crossing the road right behind us, and we even saw a bison stand up! All the while, the weather was overcast and snowy - it looked like a lovely winter wonderland (with a healthy dose of green since it _is_ May).

Once we got into Lamar Valley, it was completely sunny and noticeably warmer. Nearby the Lamar River, we saw **SO MANY HERDS** of bison, all with plenty of young and baby bison grazing and loafing around. We even got to see bison cross the road right in front of our car! That was kind of scary (what if they thought we were too close?), but it was a fantastic sight. We even saw one bison friend wait for his other friend to stop monching, and they started galloping together after crossing the road! That was super cute. In Lamar Valley, we also got to see antelopes and mountain goats! The latter we got to see super up close - it had unnerving eyes.

## 2:30 pm
Having seen plenty of animals, we decided to head back west then south toward Norris Geyser Basin (sadly, the Roosevelt-Canyon road was closed :( ). On the drive back, we saw a bear! But not before it started snowing again. The weather in this park is just so weird sometimes.

After a short pit-stop at Mammoth Hot Springs General Store to refill water and grab some last-minute souvenirs (a bookmark for Dana and a shirt for Nathan), we headed south toward Norris. On the way, we got to see more bison and another bear! Nathan got a great shot of the bear looking back at the spectators.

## 4:30 pm
We finally arrived at Norris Geyser Basin. Itâ€™s snowing consistently now but still light enough for it to be no more than a minor inconvenience. Since we are getting hungry, we opted to only see 1/2 of the geysers at this time. We took the shorter loop, and we enjoyed looking at the stinky steam clouds, colorful rivers and ponds, and gurgling pools. There were green, pearl, cloudy blue, deep blue, orange, and more colors all in this small area. We threw some snow into the super hot ones for fun - it was gone in a matter of seconds.

## 6 pm
We exited the park into West Yellowstone. We were ravenous at this point, so we pull off into a nearby diner called the Timberline Cafe. We both got some bison meatloaf (after seeing so many, we had to have a bite!) with soup, mashed potatoes, and veggies. It was delicious and very filling. It started snowing much more heavily now, almost to the point of a white-out. Not wanting to be lost or worse, we decided to hop on down to the West Yellowstone Gate Hotel and check in. After unloading the bags and getting freshened up, we watched another episode of TV, updated this blog, and read a bit before going to bed. There should be some good weather tomorrow, so we hope to see Old Faithful and some of the other beautiful sights in that area tomorrow. Looking forward to it!
